📟 Python Calculator (Beginner Project)
📌 Description

This is a menu-driven calculator program written in Python, created as a beginner learning project.
The program runs in the terminal and allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations using conditional statements and loops.

The focus of this project is to practice:

User input handling

Conditional logic (if-elif-else)

Loops

Basic error handling

Writing safe, crash-free programs

🚀 Features

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Division-by-zero handling

Continuous execution using a loop

Input validation using try-except

Exit option to close the program safely

🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3

No external libraries required

📖 How the Program Works

The program displays a menu of arithmetic operations.

The user selects an operation using a number.

The program asks for two numeric inputs.

The selected operation is executed using conditional statements.

Invalid inputs are handled safely.

The program repeats until the user chooses to exit.

🧠 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced:

Using while loops for continuous programs

Handling invalid user input using try-except

Applying conditional logic for decision making

Preventing runtime errors like division by zero

Structuring a simple Python program logically
